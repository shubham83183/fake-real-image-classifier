# fake-real-image-classifier
Task Description:
1. To classify the real and fake images, where the fake images have been generated using SNGAN
 using different up sampling techniques:
   * Bilinear interpolation
   * Bicubic interpolation
   * Pixel shuffle
2. Is the model working for other up sampling techniques?
3. Can we get better results by using vertical and horizontal projections instead of
radial ones, when images are transformed in frequency domain?
